This repository contains an example of what is explained in https://dev-otion.com/en/entry/global-styles-in-tailwindcss-through-the-configuration-file

For simplicityÂ¡s seak, it's running TailwindCSS from scratch. If you are using a framework (Vite, Next.js, Angular,...), you must configure TailwindCSS accordingly.

If you're using this repo, install the needed dependencies by running `npm install`, then you can run `npm run compile_css` each time you modify a global style or each time you add a TailwindCSS class to the HTML.
